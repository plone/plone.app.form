plone.app.form
==========

Overview
--------

The plone.app.form package gives Plone the ability to better adapt common
Zope 3 UI style functionality to a more appropriate Plone style.

Features
--------

  - **Better integration with zope.formlib.**  The default templates
    distributed with zope.formlib are table-based and don't follow
    common Plone UI patterns, plone.app.form addresses this.  Also,
    plone.app.form patches zope.formlib so that the base classes from
    there can be used as-is.
