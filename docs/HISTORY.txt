plone.app.form - 1.0.5 Unreleased

    - Added support for readonly, addonly and removeonly to multi USW.
      Warning! Readonly is implemented in code, but addonly and removeonly is
      only done in the UI!
      [fschulze]

    - For the USW:
      Made description of search result and current selection items
      consistent, always include the current selection fieldset (hidden if
      empty) and added CSS classes to the current selection and search result
      fieldsets.
      [fschulze]

    - Fix widget error rendering in template (added structure keyword).

      checkboxes.

plone.app.form - 1.0.3 Released

    - Fixed fall back to language name in LanguageDropdownChoiceWidget.
      [hannosch]

    - Added i18n markup to the formlib base templates, so the required message
      will be translated the same way as in the rest of Plone. This closes
      http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7063.
      [hannosch]

plone.app.form - 1.0.1 Released

    - Add a form validator that only validates an action when updating a
      form. This makes it possible to add actions manually in the template
      without having formlib autogenerate buttons in other places.

    - Let the UberSelectionWidget handle optional fields properly.

    - Added a new DisabledCheckBoxWidget, which renders a disabled variant of
      the CheckBoxWidget.
