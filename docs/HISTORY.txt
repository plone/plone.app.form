Changelog for plone.app.form

    (name of developer listed in brackets)

plone.app.form - 1.1 UNRELEASED

    - Added i18n markup to the formlib base templates, so the required message
      will be translated the same way as in the rest of Plone. This closes
      http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7063.

    - Add a form validator that only validates an action when updating a
      form. This makes it possible to add actions manually in the template
      without having formlib autogenerate buttons in other places.

      the CheckBoxWidget.
