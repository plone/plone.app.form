1.1.8 - 2009-10-09
------------------

- Made default truncation size of 20 results on the uberselectionwidget
  configurable by a simple variable called `limit_results` on the widget.
  [hannosch]

- Fixed return value of multi selection widget _value method. The template
  tries to get len() of the value, but fails if the value is None. This allows
  to use multi selection widget in the portlets, for example.

1.1.6 - 2008-11-21
------------------

- Made a test less dependent on the exact HTML output, so it works across
  Zope versions with slightly different newline ending semantics.
  [hannosch]

- Only include KSS subpackage if kss.core is available.
  [hannosch]

- Fixed KSS payload tests to omit a trailing newline.
  [hannosch]

- Use structure for errors again, this seems to have been lost in the merge
  of r19540.

      empty) and added CSS classes to the current selection and search result
      fieldsets.
      [fschulze]

      errors, instead of all messages (info and error both) as errors.

    - Fixed fall back to language name in LanguageDropdownChoiceWidget.
      [hannosch]

    - Added i18n markup to the formlib base templates, so the required message

      [hannosch]

plone.app.form - 1.0.1 Released

    - Add a form validator that only validates an action when updating a

    - Let the UberSelectionWidget handle optional fields properly.

    - Added a new DisabledCheckBoxWidget, which renders a disabled variant of
      the CheckBoxWidget.
      [hannosch]

      closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5833.
