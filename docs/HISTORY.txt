plone.app.form - 1.1.6 Released November 21st, 2008

    - Only include KSS subpackage if kss.core is available.
      [hannosch]

    - Fixed KSS payload tests to omit a trailing newline.

    - Fixed fall back to language name in LanguageDropdownChoiceWidget.

      [hannosch]

      the CheckBoxWidget.
